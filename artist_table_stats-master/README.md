##Artist Platform Challenge:

The objective of this challenge is to provide a very basic artist platform which provides a quick snapshot of signup statistics and provides a quick filter / sort on a table view. Utilized a large data set of artists in the JSON format.

####Tools Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Angular.js
- Materialize (for styling)
- UI.Grid (for table layout)
- C3 (library of D3 for charts)
- Moment.js (to manipulate dates)

_Note:_ I used Materialize, UI.Grid and Moment.js with no prior experience. I've been wanting to explore those libraries and the project was a great opportunity for me to explore and test them out.

####How To Install:
- Fork and clone the repo [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/mihirchronicles/artist_table_stats)
- Go under the root folder "public"
- Bower install libraries. Run command line **bower install --save-dev** to install the libraries.
- Run command line **http server** on your terminal
- To run the app, open up your browser and type in **localhost:8080** in your address bar.
